# SJ02 Strategy Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the SJ02 Advanced Market Analysis Strategy, a sophisticated 3-candle pattern trading system.

## Strategy Concept

SJ02 is an advanced 3-candle pattern trading strategy that identifies specific engulfing patterns for high-probability trading opportunities. It uses a unified implementation that combines pattern detection, signal generation, and comprehensive reporting.

## Key Features

- **3-Candle Pattern Detection**: Identifies specific engulfing patterns
- **Multi-Mode Analysis**: Supports bullish, bearish, and combined analysis
- **Advanced Signal Generation**: Automatic entry/exit level calculation
- **Risk Management**: Built-in 1:1 risk/reward ratio
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed analysis and visualization

## Pattern Detection Logic

### Bullish Pattern (Long Signal)
1. **Candle 3 Range Engulfment**: C3 must completely engulf C2's range
2. **Candle 3 Body Engulfment**: C3 must completely engulf C1's body
3. **Decisive Close**: C3 must close above both C1 and C2 body tops

### Bearish Pattern (Short Signal)
1. **Candle 3 Range Engulfment**: C3 must completely engulf C2's range
2. **Candle 3 Body Engulfment**: C3 must completely engulf C1's body
3. **Decisive Close**: C3 must close below both C1 and C2 body bottoms

## Signal Generation

### Entry Rules
- **Buy Signal**: Entry at High of Candle 3, Stop Loss at Low of Candle 3
- **Sell Signal**: Entry at Low of Candle 3, Stop Loss at High of Candle 3
- **Take Profit**: 1:1 Risk/Reward ratio automatically calculated

### Strategy Components
- **Pattern Detector**: Identifies 3-candle engulfing patterns
- **Signal Generator**: Calculates entry/exit levels
- **Risk Manager**: Implements 1:1 risk/reward ratio
- **Report Generator**: Creates comprehensive HTML reports

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from strategy_adapter import create_strategy

# Create strategy instance
strategy = create_strategy()

# Analyze data for all patterns
results = strategy.analyze(data, mode='combined')

# Analyze for specific patterns
bullish_results = strategy.analyze(data, mode='bullish')
bearish_results = strategy.analyze(data, mode='bearish')
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
config = {
    "risk_management": {
        "risk_reward_ratio": 1.0,
        "max_risk_percent": 1.5
    },
    "filters": {
        "min_pattern_strength": 0.5,
        "min_signal_strength": 0.6
    }
}

strategy = create_strategy(config)
results = strategy.analyze(data, mode='combined')
```

## Analysis Results

### Output Structure
```python
{
    'status': 'success',
    'strategy_type': 'COMBINED',
    'patterns': [...],           # Detected patterns
    'signals': [...],            # Generated trading signals
    'pattern_statistics': {...}, # Pattern analysis stats
    'signal_statistics': {...},  # Signal generation stats
    'summary': {
        'total_patterns': 4,
        'total_signals': 3,
        'signal_rate': 0.75,
        'avg_signal_strength': 0.78
    }
}
```
