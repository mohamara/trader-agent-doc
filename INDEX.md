- **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: Scalable, monitored, and maintainable

### How to Evaluate
1. **Review Architecture**: Understand the system design and scalability
2. **Examine Strategies**: Review available strategies and their methodologies
3. **Analyze Performance**: Review backtest results and risk metrics
4. **Assess Technology**: Evaluate the technical stack and infrastructure

## üîß Quick Start for Developers

### System Components
- **Core Engine**: Python FastAPI backend with strategy analysis
- **Web Panel**: React-based frontend for configuration and visualization
- **Infrastructure**: TimescaleDB, InfluxDB, Redis, monitoring stack

### Key Files to Understand
- `core-engine/src/analysis/strategy_engine.py` - Main analysis orchestrator
- `core-engine/src/core/strategy_registry.py` - Strategy management system
- `core-engine/simulator/` - Backtesting and simulation engine
- `panel/script.js` - Frontend analysis logic

### Development Workflow
1. **Strategy Development**: Implement `TradingStrategy` interface
2. **Testing**: Use built-in backtesting engine
3. **Integration**: Add to strategy registry
4. **Deployment**: Use Docker Compose for consistent environments

## üìä Understanding the Analysis Flow

### 1. Data Input
- Users upload OHLC market data (JSON/CSV)
- Select trading strategy and analysis mode
- Configure custom parameters and settings

### 2. Processing Pipeline
- Data validation and preprocessing
- Strategy loading and execution
- Signal generation and analysis
- Result formatting and serialization

### 3. Output & Visualization
- Structured JSON responses
- Interactive charts and tables
- Downloadable reports and data
- Optional backtesting simulation

## üé≤ Strategy Analysis Deep Dive

### Available Strategies
- **SJ01**: Order Block Strategy (price action + volume)
- **SJ02**: Pattern Trading Strategy (3-candle patterns)
- **MF01**: Multi-Factor Strategy (technical indicators)

### Analysis Modes
- **Bullish**: Long position opportunities
- **Bearish**: Short position opportunities
- **Combined**: Both long and short signals

### Performance Metrics
